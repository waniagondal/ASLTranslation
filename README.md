# GESTUREBRIDGE —— HUMAN CONNECTION FOR ALL 👋🌉

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**GestureBridge** is a groundbreaking **sign language translation application** that leverages machine learning to create seamless communication between individuals who use sign language and those who don't. This innovative platform captures ASL sign language gestures through a camera, interprets them, converts them into written text, and vocalizes that text—offering a **real-time, accessible communication experience**.

At its core, GestureBridge is more a bridge to fostering **greater inclusivity and understanding** between communities. By breaking down communication barriers, we hope to empower individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as their families, friends, and colleagues. We believe that **human connection** is the foundation of any thriving society, and our mission is to help people connect through language, regardless of the medium they use. 🤝💬

The platform will initially support ASL fingerspelling, with plans to extend vocabulary and functionality over time. GestureBridge will continually evolve to offer better, more accurate sign language recognition and translation, creating a more inclusive environment for all

## GESTUREBRIDGE MANIFESTO
At **GestureBridge**, we don’t just create software—we create **connections**. Our mission is to build a world where **language is no barrier** to understanding, communication, and human connection. We believe that **language**—whether spoken, written, or gestured—should empower people to share ideas, thoughts, and emotions without limitations. 

By using **GestureBridge**, you're not just accessing a tool—you're contributing to **a future where inclusivity, empathy, and understanding are the foundation** of all interactions. Together, we aim to create a more **accessible world** where **everyone is heard**, and **everyone belongs**, no matter how they communicate. 🌍💬

## FEATURES
- **Real-Time Sign Language Recognition** 🤖: GestureBridge can instantly recognize sign language via your webcam feed, allowing seamless interaction. Currently, the application supports fingerspelling, with plans to incorporate more gestures in future updates.
  
```
    public void startRecognition() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        predictor.startRecognition(this::predictionToPresenter);
    }
    private void predictionToPresenter(String prediction) {
        SignLanguageRecognitionOutputData outputData = new SignLanguageRecognitionOutputData(prediction);
        signLanguagePresenter.updateView(outputData);
    }
```

- **Multilingual Language Translation** 🌐: Recognized signs are translated into multiple languages, broadening communication between individuals across linguistic divides.
  
```
    String translatedText = languageDataAccessObject.translate(language, text);
    SignLanguageTranslationOutputData signLanguageTranslationOutputData =
        new SignLanguageTranslationOutputData(translatedText);
    signLanguageTranslationPresenter.prepareSuccessView(signLanguageTranslationOutputData);
```

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion** 🔊: GestureBridge vocalizes the recognized text in real-time, allowing for spoken communication.

```
    TextToSpeechOutputData outputData = textToSpeechService.convertTextToSpeech(inputData);
    outputBoundary.prepareOutput(outputData);
```

- **Voice Customization 🎤**: Users can personalize the speech output by adjusting voice type, pitch, speed, and volume, making the interaction feel more natural, and respecting the identities of the users.

```
    voiceSettingsDataAccessObject.changeSettings(audioSettings);

    final CustomizeVoiceOutputData customizeVoiceOutputData = new CustomizeVoiceOutputData(audioSettings, false);
    voiceSettingsPresenter.prepareSuccessView(customizeVoiceOutputData);
```

- **Speech-to-Text Transcription** 📝: Voice input from the other individual is transcribed into text, displayed for the deaf or hard of hearing person.

```
    public void processSpeech(SpeechToTextInputData inputData) throws Exception {
        String onSpeechRecognition = speechRecognizer.recognize(inputData.getAudioData());
        SpeechToTextOutputData outputData = new SpeechToTextOutputData(onSpeechRecognition);
        speechToTextPresenter.deliverTranscription(outputData);
    }

                ```
        - **Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes.**
            - When creating a pull request, write a detailed description of the changes made. Describe what the problem is, how your changes fix it, and any context that might be helpful for reviewers.
            - Include information about any testing or verification steps you took to ensure the changes work as expected.
        - **Adhere to CSC207 CheckStyle and Clean Architecture / SOLID Principles:**
            - **CheckStyle:** Ensure your code adheres to the CSC207 CheckStyle guidelines. If unsure, run the CheckStyle in your IDE or use the command line to verify your code before submitting. Follow the correct indentation, naming conventions, and other style rules
            - **Clean Architecture:** Structure your code so that it follows Clean Architecture principles, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintaining scalability and maintainability. A Clean Architecture Guide can be found [here](https://github.com/GunterMueller/Books-3/blob/master/Clean%20Architecture%20A%20Craftsman%20Guide%20to%20Software%20Structure%20and%20Design.pdf)
            - **SOLID Principles:** Ensure your code follows SOLID principles, which are:
                - **S:** Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Each class should have only one reason to change.
                - **O:** Open/Closed Principle (OCP) – The software should be open for extension but closed for modification.
                - **L:** Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
                - **I:** Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
                - **D:** Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

    - #### Review and Merge Protocols
